        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>As a researcher, my interests lie in NLP and data science. I'm currently focusing on leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs) to convert natural language into structured query languages, aiming to enhance question-and-answer systems in specialized knowledge domains.</p>

        <p>In the realm of Neural Information Retrieval, I have been involved in creating semantic search engines. These engines efficiently analyze scientific papers by integrating exact match and semantic similarity approaches, thus improving information retrieval accuracy and efficiency.</p>

        <p>Beyond these areas, my research extends to advancing lengthy text analysis, few-shot/zero-shot document categorization, and exploring other novel NLP tasks. I am also actively engaged in the research and development of retrieval-augmented language models.</p>

        <p>My research endeavors aim to contribute to AI and computational science through innovative and practical solutions, encompassing ontologies, semantic web, and knowledge graph integration in AI systems.</p>
